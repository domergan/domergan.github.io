# Building an 8-Bit CPU on an FPGA

I once came upon Ben Eater’s series of YouTube videos about building an 8-bit computer on a series of breadboards. I watched the entire series but didn’t have the energy to complete the project myself. Then a few months ago I decided to finally give it a go. But the act of actually cutting wire seemed very tedius. 

So I thought about emulating the cpu on a fpga which would also allow me to learn a bit more on VHDL.  

I'm using a 10M08 MAX 10 fpga module from Intel. This fpga is much more capable than what this project needs but its biggest down side is its volatile memory. There are better options out there such as the the TinyFPGA BX which is cheap(er) ($38), open-source, small and can be placed onta a breadboard.

## FPGA SAP-1

The SAP-1 is a good introductory FPGA project because it's pretty simple to implement and it can fit on a small FPGA.

The SAP (Simple-As-Possible) computer has been designed for beginners. The main purpose is to introduce all the crucial ideas behind computer operation without burying in unnecessary details. Three generations of SAP computer exists. I will focus on the first one. 

## HDL vs Software

Learning how to write code (if you can call it that) for an FPGA is a very different experience from writing code for a CPU. In this case, the Verilog code that is written for the FPGA is describing logic to create a CPU while normal programming is actually running on a CPU. There are a lot of gotchas that can confuse and mislead you if you go into it thinking it’s just another programming language.

The biggest mental block is serial vs parallel. When writing software code (usually) executes from top to bottom in a linear fashion, one statement after the next (ignoring loops and such). With an FPGA, everything is executing concurrently because you’re describing circuits full of multiple wires.

It took a bit of time to shift my mind towards this paradigm because I’m so used to writing code that runs on a CPU. I’m used to ordering statements so that if B depends on A, A is defined before B. But with Verilog the order of statements doesn’t matter because everything is evaluated as a whole.

## Describing the CPU

With Verilog you’re describing the logical behavior of a circuit and relying on the FPGA tools to synthesize your design into the gates on the FPGA that will do what you want. Similar to how you describe a program in C and trust the compiler to generate assembly for you.
